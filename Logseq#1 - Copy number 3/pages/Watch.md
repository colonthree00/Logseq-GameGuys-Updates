- Watch's other names/Titles:
  collapsed:: true
	- Eye of Blindness

- Watch is blind, yet he can see.
- Watch is a product of the Vitriol.
	- If [[Rotri]] was freed, would "somehow" be chained and would regain his sight, causing [[The Vitriol]] to emerge. He will then disappear(? dms i'm going off of are confusing) until The Vitriol is blinded again. Another possibility is that [[The Anger]] would becomes "muted", and would cause changes to [[Swift Salvatore]] and [[Rotri]].
