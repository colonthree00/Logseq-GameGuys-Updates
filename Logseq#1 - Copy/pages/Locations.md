- The Æther (Tranquility)
  collapsed:: true
	- "The Æther is a location in headspace that represents pure tranquillity. It is a floating island above the clouds where the sun never sets, but is always setting, and the weather is always perfect. There are four pillars of white marble on the island, forming a square. Inside this square is an array of short marble platforms, alternating between white and black marble. The black marble platforms are rotated by 45 degrees. In the very centre, a grey square marble platform sits. This is where one would meditate. "

	- "The domain of The Jester, a seemingly infinitely massive circus tent lit by old lightbulbs. One can often find The Jester here, and when he is there, he will appear in whichever room you are in. One can find various unused circus equipment in every room, and even a cage of lions somewhere."

- The Stairwell
  collapsed:: true
	- "Outside the walls of ??? one can find a light grass patch, and in its centre, an old well. Upon looking inside the well, one will see that while there is water at the bottom, some distance down one can see open windows, and through a crevasse in the wall, one can see a spiral staircase coiling around the outside of the well underground. No one has been able to descend below the waters."

- Beneath Tranquility
	- "The foundation of The Æther: The Infinite Dark. Or at least… it was. As soon as The Dispair arrived and ???, Watch fashioned a cell out of The Infinite Dark: the conceptually strongest holding cell called “Beneath Tranquility.” This place splits the aspects (not to be confused with The Aspects) of infinity and darkness: the infinity makes it a prison without walls, while the darkness subdues the mind of its holders. On top of all this, Watch wanted to make absolutely sure The Dispair wouldn’t get out. He designed chains based off of The Dispair’s chains, and locked The Dispair in them. The chains pull their holder towards any centre of darkness which is strongest. This keeps The Dispair’s mind completely addled in the very centre of Beneath Tranquility."
